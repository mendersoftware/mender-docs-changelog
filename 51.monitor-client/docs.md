### Changelogs

#### monitor-client (1.2.0)

New changes in monitor-client since 1.1.0:

##### Bug fixes

* Use and honour ALERT_OFFLINE_STORE_MAX_COUNT setting.
* Increasing read timeout in the pattern expiration worker.
* Clean the variables each time the main loop continues. This was a bug, which manifested itself only when a certain order of sourced files came to be. As we use find for gathering of the files, special cirtumstances must occur for it to be triggered.
  ([MEN-5508](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5508))
* Include log pattern and log path in the alert emails.
  ([MEN-5600](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5600))

##### Features

* Make the log subssytem general enough to be a base for any user-defined subsystem.
  ([MEN-5508](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5508))
* Use the core log subsystem to create a pseudo subsystem: dockerevents.
  ([MEN-5508](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5508))

##### Other

* Handle exiting commands in the streamline logs case.
* Do not alert when daemon is being shutdown.

  After the introduction of the proxy, on shutdown the device is always
  considered to be offline. That in combination with the aletrs storing
  and service monitoring means that all monitored services will report
  CRITICAL on the next boot. Those criticals will never disapear
  (without restarting a given service), since on boot everything
  is in an OK state again.

  When daemon is being shutdown, now we will not monitor any services.
* Return from monitor_send_alert immediately if shutdown is in progress.

  It is possible that during the shutdown we are in the middle of a check,
  in that case monitor_send_alert can be called while the daemon is being
  shutdown. This closes the possibility of sending the alerts at that time.
* Do not alert when log check is already in CRITICAL state.

  If log check is in the critical state: do not send the alert.
  This means that once the pattern is present in the logs,
  only one alert will be sent. Note: the behaviour can be further
  configured with LOG_PATTERN_EXPIRATION setting, to trigger
  OK/CRITICAL chain as needed.
  ([MEN-5458](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5458))
* dockerevents is moved away from examples directory, it is now based on the log subsystem.
  ([MEN-5508](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5508))


## monitor-client 1.1.0

_Released 01.24.2022_

### Changelogs

#### monitor-client (1.1.0)

New changes in monitor-client since 1.0.0:

* monitorctl: warn on non-existent command.
* Clean excessive warning from the periodical alert store check.
* Fix failure when sending many stored alerts. Previously, an attempt to send large local alert store could trigger `126 Argument list too long` error and  no alerts would be sent.
  ([MEN-5133](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5133))
* Correctly escape especial characters when saving alerts in the local store.
  ([MEN-5133](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5133))
* Move local store unlock calls away from the trap, which may lead to races
* monitorctl: report error and exit when enabling/disabling non available checks
  ([MEN-5190](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5190))
* monitorctl: Return the exit code properly and no output on successful execution. Previously monitorctl would always exit with code 0 even on errors
  ([MEN-5172](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5172))
* monitorctl: Fix the issue with enable, disable, delete and create commands not returning the exit code correctly, which in turn leads to improper exit code of monitorctl tool
  ([MEN-5172](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5172))
* Store configuration data on enabled checks.
  ([MEN-5185](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5185))
* Remove device_online check, treating all errors to reach the
  Mender server as "device is offline", saving the alerts in the store for
  later re-send.
  ([MEN-5216](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5216))
* Add a variable for permanent in-memory key-values for subsystems

  This is then used in the subsystems like so:

  subsystem=disk

  PERMANENT_STORAGE_FOR_DISK[LAST_ALARM]=OK

  or similar, which means now that every subsystem has a unified way of storing
  state data.
* Add example monitor implementation to the examples/monitors, and
  examples/subsystems directory. Install and uninstall them with the
  make (un)install-example-monitors targets in the Makefile. Enable them with the
  'enable-example-monitors' target. The added subsystems are a connectivity
  system, for HTTP HEAD requests to a given server on an optional interface. A
  container subsystem for monitoring container actions as given by docker events,
  and a subsystem for monitoring disk usage of an optional disk, and warn on a
  given treshold, if the disk starts filling up.
  ([MEN-5137](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5137))
* Remove records older than given time from alerts store.
  ([MEN-5336](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5336))
* Increase the log lines sent within alerts
  ([MEN-5361](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5361))
* Handle exiting commands in the streamline logs case.
