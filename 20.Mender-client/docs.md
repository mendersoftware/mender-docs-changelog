### Changelogs

#### mender (4.0.0)

Mender client version 4.0.0 has been completely rewritten from scratch in C++. To ensure a
successful migration, there are a number of changes which are important to pay attention to. The
complete list of changes is below, but for a more user friendly migration guide, please see the
[Upgrading guide](https://docs.mender.io/3.7/client-installation/install-with-debian-package/upgrading)
in the Mender documentation.

New changes in mender since 3.5.2:

##### Bug Fixes

* disabled implicit conversion form Error to bool
  ([MEN-6409](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6409))
* README: add build instructions for C++-client
* latest openssl reports "no such file" if the cert doesn't exist
* Rootfs scripts in the C++ client are checked in the same way as
  `Artifact` scripts, and hence, we are now moving it to support only `version 3`.
  While in the old `Golang` client both version `2` and `3` were supported.
  ([MEN-6671](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6671))
* The client no longer erronously commits a rootfs-image
  artifact after being restarted using `systemctl restart` in the
  `ArtifactReboot` state.
  ([MEN-6633](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6633))

##### Features

* The client's HSM crypto-module support is changed so that the
  `PrivateKey` used for `authentication` is always taken from the configurations:
  `security.AuthPrivateKey`, and the `HttpsClient.private_key` is only used as the
  key for the associated certificate `HttpsClient.client_certificate`. The two can
  still use the same key, but this means now that you add the same key `url` in
  both places.
  ([MEN-6668](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6668))

##### Other

* The rootfs-image updater is no longer built in, but is an
  Update Module, available under the name `rootfs-image`.
* Remove `DbusEnabled` config option.

  Mender now always depends on DBus.
  ([MEN-6662](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6662))
* Remove `BootUtilitiesGetNextActivePart` and
  `BootUtilitiesSetActivePart` config options. These are not necessary
  anymore since the choice of tool, including its calling arguments, can
  be programmed directly into each update module instead.
  ([MEN-6662](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6662))
* Update Control support has been removed from the client.
  ([MEN-6647](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6647))
* `--forcebootstrap` is not a global cli option anymore,
  but an option specific to `mender-auth daemon` and `mender-auth
  bootstrap` commands.
  ([MEN-6679](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6679))
* Mender daemon does not anymore integrate with `syslog`,
  handling the logs is responsibility of `systemd` or the caller.
  ([MEN-6679](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6679))
* Global flag `--no-syslog` is removed.
  ([MEN-6679](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6679))
* Remove `--passphrase-file` option from command scopes where
  it has no use. Move it to `mender-auth daemon` and `mender-auth
  bootstrap` commands.
  ([MEN-6679](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6679))
* mention the deprecation of control maps
  ([MEN-6648](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6648))
* Mender client does not use HTTP Keep-Alive anymore. The
  related configuration option `Connectivity` is deprecated. The TCP
  connection will be terminated as soon as the HTTP request/response is
  finished, and every subsequent HTTP request will open a new TCP
  connection.
  ([MEN-6862](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6862))
* systemd service `mender-client` does not exist anymore.
  Dependencies shall depend either `mender-authd` or `mender-updated`.
  ([MEN-6858](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6858))

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.5.2)

New changes in mender since 3.5.1:

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix a rare bug which could corrupt the very end of a
  rootfs-image update on a sudden powerloss. The circumstances where it
  could happen are quite specific: The filesystem size in the update
  need to *not* be a multiple of the native sector size, which is very
  uncommon. The sector size is typically 512 bytes almost everywhere,
  and hence filesystem also follow this block size, if not bigger. The
  exception is raw Flash/UBI devices, where the sector size can be much
  larger, and not a power of two, and hence these platforms may be more
  susceptible.

##### Features

* recover from a corrupted database renaming it as `broken` and starting with a new empty one
  ([MEN-6848](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6848))

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.5.0)

New changes in mender since 3.4.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* The daemon no longer exits in the edge case where it cannot bring
  down the proxy server due to timeouts.
  ([ME-3](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-3))
* The websockets are no longer left trying to open a connection to the
  server, when the proxy server is shut down.
  ([ME-3](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-3))
* Expand the check for new openssl version
* systemd: Always try restarting the client if it exits.
  ([ME-33](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-33))
* websocket connectivity through http-proxy if configured

  Enables websocket connections to be established through an
  http-proxy configurable by setting the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment
  variable. This renders services that relies on websocket
  connections, such as `mender-connect`, compatible with
  http-proxying. ([ME-5](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-5))
* client not to skip custom TLS if an http-proxy is configured

  Previously, Mender client supported http-proxying but ignored
  custom TLS client configuration if present. This change renders
  any custom TLS configurations, such as Mutual TLS, compatible with
  http-proxying.
  ([MEN-6009](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6009))
* do not ignore software versioning opts in the module artifact gens
  ([MEN-6026](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6026))
* Add `--no-syslog` to the service file to ensure no
  duplicate log messages in the journal.
  ([MEN-6070](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6070))
* change mender-inventory-hostinfo to use the output of hostname

##### Features

* Install bootstrap Artifact on first start-up.

  On start-up, Mender checks for the existence of an special bootstrap
  Artifact in path `/var/lib/mender/bootstrap.mender` and installs it in
  order to initialize the device database.

  This applies both for `daemon` start and cli commands `bootstrap` and
  `install`.

  The Artifact is not installed if the device already has a database. When
  the Artifact is not found (and the database is empty) the database is
  initialized with `artifact-name=unknown`.

  In addition, Mender can also understand other kinds of "empty" Artifacts
  and install them either in managed or standalone modes.
  ([MEN-2583](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2583))
* Remove support for `artifact_info` file. The initial artifact
  name will be populated in the database using a bootstrap Artifact.
  ([MEN-2583](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2583))
* do not check if the artifact is already installed
  ([MEN-6129](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6129))
* Support multiple verifications keys

  https://hub.mender.io/t/multiple-artifactverifykeys/4309/6

  Creates a new client config parameter called ArtifactVerifyKeys that is
  a list of paths to keys. Any matching key can be used to verify an
  artifact - e.g. if 5 verification keys are provided, only 1 needs to
  match to verify the artifact.
* Add a thread: <proxy> field to the proxy logger

  Now the proxy logger stands out in the logs more, and can thus be filtered
  easier with tools parsing structured logs. This means that a log line from the
  `proxy` thread goes from looking like:

  ```
  Oct 05 08:50:06 qemux86-64 mender[259]: time="2022-10-05T08:50:06Z" level=error msg="error forwarding from client to backend: websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF"
  ```

  To:

  ```
  Oct 05 08:50:06 qemux86-64 mender[259]: time="2022-10-05T08:50:06Z" level=error thread="proxy" msg="error forwarding from client to backend: websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF"
  ```
* The default folders (`/etc/mender`, `/usr/share/mender` and
  `/var/lib/mender`) can now be overridden through the environment
  variables: `MENDER_CONF_DIR`, `MENDER_DATA_DIR`, `MENDER_DATASTORE_DIR`.
* Add zstd compression support

##### Other

* Replace obsolescent `egrep` with `grep -E` in inventory script

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.4.0)

New changes in mender since 3.3.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* setenv: Fix script input syntax.
* rootfs-image-v2: Make sure to set mender_boot_part_hex
* By default we bind to 127.0.0.1:0 instead of localhost.
* Over D-Bus we return the ProxyHost equal to 127.0.0.1
* Upgrade openssl dependency to fix cast error in recent Go.
* If paused before ArtifactReboot, and then manually
  rebooting the device outside of Mender, the client will properly
  resume the update now, instead of failing and rolling back.
  ([MEN-5709](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5709))
* Append log entries to syslog at the correct level
* The client update and inventory checks are now unaffected by the use
  of the `check-update` and `send-inventory` commands. While previously, this
  would both move the intervals at which checks we're done, and also extend them
  beyond the expected polling intervals configured.
  ([MEN-5547](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5547))
* Resolve symlinks for /dev/disk/by-partlabel

##### Features

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.3.1)

New changes in mender since 3.3.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* Upgrade openssl dependency to fix cast error in recent Go.
* If paused before ArtifactReboot, and then manually
  rebooting the device outside of Mender, the client will properly
  resume the update now, instead of failing and rolling back.
  ([MEN-5709](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5709))
* The client update and inventory checks are now unaffected by the use
  of the `check-update` and `send-inventory` commands. While previously, this
  would both move the intervals at which checks we're done, and also extend them
  beyond the expected polling intervals configured.
  ([MEN-5547](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5547))
* Append log entries to syslog at the correct level
* By default we bind to 127.0.0.1:0 instead of localhost.
* Over D-Bus we return the ProxyHost equal to 127.0.0.1
* Resolve symlinks for /dev/disk/by-partlabel
* The daemon no longer exits in the edge case where it cannot bring
  down the proxy server due to timeouts.
* The websockets are no longer left trying to open a connection to the
  server, when the proxy server is shut down.

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.3.0)

New changes in mender since 3.2.1:

##### Bug Fixes

* Only fall back to older endpoints on HTTP 404's



  Make the client only fall back to older endpoints on HTTP 404 error codes when
  polling the `deployments/next` endpoint.

  Previous functionality fell back to older endpoints on all error codes. This in
  turn meant that when the client got rate-limited by the server on 429's, the
  client fell back to the older endpoints.

  The problem with this is that only the POSTv2 endpoint supports control maps, so
  when an update with control maps was in progress, the other endpoints would
  return 204, and the client would think the deployment was aborted from the server.
  ([MEN-5421](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5421))
* Fixed an issue in which long-running systems, with a long time
  between reboots, and multiple updates encountered the `Tried maximum amount of
  times` error, due to an error in the retry logic.
* Log the fallback to the `artifact_info` file at log level Warn, when
  the Artifact name can not be retrieved from the database.
* add an After systemd dependency on mender-client-data-dir
* The `mender-client.service` file now has an explicit `After`
  dependency on the `data.mount` target, to make sure it is mounted, before the
  client commences operation.
* Fix Git error when installing after the fix for the
  [CVE-2022-24765 Git
  vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24765)
  ([Github's description of the
  issue](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/)).
  This also fixes a subtle "pseudo abort" issue which can occur in the
  Yocto build environment.
* the HTTP proxy must bind on localhost, not on all the interfaces
  ([MEN-5642](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5642))
* Don't accumulate zombies when command output parsing fails.
  ([MEN-5587](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5587))
* Only capture module stdout when requested
  ([MEN-5098](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5098))
* Fix printing of update module stdout in real-time

##### Features

* Allow to disable HTTP Keep-Alive from config, set idle timeout.
* Inventory push retries and backoff.

  We use RetryPollIntervalSeconds in inventory with the exponential
  backoff via GetExponentialBackoffTime together with a new setting:
  * RetryPollCount -- the max number of tries
  * inventory by default tries 3 times with one minute intervals
    (GetExponentialBackoffTime defaults)
* RetryPollCount applies to all places where backoff is present

##### Other

* Add alternate EFI path to mender-inventory-bootloader-integration
* Add alternate EFI path to mender-inventory-bootloader-inte…
* Add support for the `GET /v2/deployments/device/deployments/{id}/update_control_map` endpoint.
  ([MEN-5542](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5542))

##### Dependabot bumps

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.2.0)

New changes in mender since 3.1.0:

* [FIX] Fetch geo location data once per power cycle
* The client now shows output from scripts executed in the log as regular
  log messages, prefixed by the filedescriptor they are written to, and the script
  executed, like this: 'Output (stdout|stderr) from command \"/usr/bin/foo\": bar.'
  ([MEN-5098](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5098))
* Bump github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact to 3.6.1
* Fix error not finding active partition for systems where /dev/root is a symlink
* installer/bootenv: support systemd-boot tools
* Upgrade golang.org/x/crypto to the latest version
* Title if the update module has not already requested a reboot. This
  is done, in the case that ArtifactInstall never finished, and hence the reboot
  information from the update module is never collected.
  ([MEN-4882](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4882))
* Upgrade from deprecated `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal` to
  `golang.org/x/term`
  ([QA-235](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/QA-235))
* Mender starts a local HTTP server that will proxy incoming
  requests to `/api/devices` to the currently authenticated Mender server.
  The existing D-Bus API endpoints GetJwtToken and JwtTokenStateChange
  will now return the local address together with the JWT token. Supports
  also websocket upgrade when calling
  `/api/devices/v1/deviceconnect/connect` endpoint
  ([MEN-5216](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5216))
* mender setup: Deprecate `--demo` flag and split its
  functionality across new flags `--demo-server` to configure the device
  for a Mender demo server and `--demo-polling` to use demo polling
  intervals. ([MEN-5138](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5138))
* Client will no longer cache the Authorization token from
  the server across restarts, meaning that it is no longer possible to
  end up in the situation where a rootfs update with invalid
  authorization data succeeds, only to fail authorization later on when
  the token expires.
  ([MEN-5217](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5217))
* It is no longer possible to change the identity of a device
  with a rootfs update. This was not supported before either, but worked
  in a hacky way by abusing the authorization token to get a rootfs
  update with new identity data to succeed. Afterwards the device would
  show up as a new device when the token expired.
  ([MEN-5217](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5217))
* ubi: Get rid of useless warning: `Could not resolve path link: ubi..`
* Refresh update control maps before failing an update

  Fix the issue where if a state takes longer than the expiration time
  for the enabled update control map, then by the time the client checks its
  control maps, the map is expired, and the update fails.

  Now the client refreshes the update maps from the server before each pause, and
  hence, this issue will be avoided.
  ([MEN-5096](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5096))
* Handle the possibility of losing network connectivity when refreshing
  the update control maps.
* Fix a race condition which can happen during a reboot if
  systemd kills the `reboot` command before it kills the Mender client.
  ([MEN-5340](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5340))
* When an update is paused, the client now queries the server
  for updates using the `UpdatePollIntervalSeconds` interval if it is
  shorter than `UpdateControlMapExpirationTimeSeconds`, enabling quicker
  response when continuing an update.
* Fix a (possible) file descriptor leak.
* vendor: Bump mender-artifact to latest master version

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.1.0)

New changes in mender since 3.0.0:

* Fix a bug which could sometimes lead the client to do a
  rollback after it had already committed. This could happen if the
  client happened to spontaneously reboot or fail during the status
  update to the server. Doing this is not correct according to the state
  flow, and can have unexpected consequences depending on the
  combination of Update Modules and State Scripts.
  ([MEN-4830](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4830))
* mender-inventory-network: Fix incompatibility with busybox,
  by using short command line options in grep command.
  ([MEN-4851](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4851))
* Do not put useless and sometimes even incorrect zero values
  in the configuration file when running `mender setup`.
  ([MEN-4857](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4857))
* Extend logs for docker module
* Add artifact_name to device provides if not found in store
* Support passing docker run CLI arguments when deploying
  an artifact using the `docker` _update module_.
* Implement support for non-U-Boot tool names.
  The tools still have to be command line compatible with the U-Boot
  tools (either u-boot-fw-utils or libubootenv), but the names can be
  different. This allows having U-Boot tools installed alongside
  grub-mender-grubenv tools, whose new names are
  `grub-mender-grubenv-set` and `grub-mender-grubenv-print`, instead of
  `fw_setenv` and `fw_printenv`.
  The two new configuration settings `BootUtilitiesSetActivePart` and
  `BootUtilitiesGetNextActivePart` have been introduced to configure the
  names. If no names are set, then the default is to try the
  grub-mender-grubenv tools first, followed by the "fw_" tools if the
  former are not found.
  ([MEN-3978](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3978))
* Add missing filesystem sync which could produce an empty or
  corrupted Update Module file tree in
  `/var/lib/mender/modules/v3/payloads/0000/tree/files/` after an
  unexpected reboot.
* If the mender.conf file has a new server URL or tenant token, the
  client will now remove the cached authorization token upon the next restart of
  the dameon, and hence respect the new configuration, as opposed to letting it
  expire, which was the old functionality.
  ([MEN-3420](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3420))
* [FIX] Fetch geo location data once per power cycle

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.0.0)

New changes in mender since 2.6.0:

* mender setup: when configuring for demo using self-signed
  certificate, install the certificate in the local trust store so that
  all components in the system (namely, Mender addons) can trust the
  Mender server without extra configuration.
  ([MEN-4580](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4580))
* Warn in the log when the system certificates contain the demo cert.
* Dont Verify SSL if skip verify is set
  If skip verify is set , then we shouldnt call VerifyResult
* Fix infinite carriage return output when running in ADB shell
* Add a DBus endpoint for the UpdateControlMap, which allows
  a user to set the `ID` and `Priority` of a given update process.
  ([MEN-4535](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4535))
* The daemon will no longer crash if mender check-update or send-inventory is used before the daemon has finished its set up.
  ([MEN-4074](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4074))
* Update Modules Artifact generators: correct --software-version flag
* single-file-artifact-gen: Support concurrent executions
* single-file Update Module: fix rollback functionality
* Add UpdateControlMapBootExpirationTimeSeconds to mender.conf.
* The location of the device type file is now determined by the mender.conf file. If the device type file is not used in mender.conf, the device type file is determined by the --data flag and if the flag is not used, the device type file is set to default. In addition, the scripts and modules directories location is consistent with the --data flag now.
  ([MEN-4669](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4669))
* Implement the continue/pause/fail state machine logic
  This adds support for the explit control of the Mender state machine through the
  update control maps functionality.
  The state machine can be controlled through the verbs, puase/continue/fail in
  the states:
  * ArtifactInstall_Enter
  * ArtifactCommit_Enter
  * ArtifactReboot_Enter
  ([MEN-4549](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4549))
* Fix D-Bus timeout on errors by finishing handling
  ([MEN-4703](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4703))
* Report to deployments/status when pausing in any state
  ([MEN-4624](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4624))
* Fix race condition in menderAuthManagerService due to
  concurrent map access. This could manifest either as a crash, or as a
  failure to deliver the JwtToken to dependent processes, such as
  mender-connect.
* Fix race condition in `dbus.RegisterMethodCallCallback` due
  to concurrent map access. This could manifest either as a crash, or as
  a failure to deliver the JwtToken to dependent processes, such as
  mender-connect.
* Fix: Correctly log the error response message from server errors
* Fix occasional crash when exiting using SIGTERM.
* Fix: `mender-client.service` and the old `mender.service`
  services can no longer run at the same time. If anyone has both, then
  `mender.service` should be removed from the system.
* Previously the Mender client would hide output from the
  child processes it ran, leading to errors from tools such as
  `fw_printenv`, not showing up in the logs.
  Now default to showing all output from the child processes called in
  the client logs.
* The client now supports the HTTP Device API v2.
  ([MEN-4785](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4785))
* Mark deployment as failed on bad signature instead of retrying.
* CLI commands prefixed with hyphen are now deprecated, use
  instead directly the command name. For example `mender daemon`, `mender
  commit`, `mender show-artifact`, etc.
  ([MEN-4808](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4808))
* Remove deprecated flag --log-modules
  ([MEN-4808](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4808))
* Fix a bug which could sometimes lead the client to do a
  rollback after it had already committed. This could happen if the
  client happened to spontaneously reboot or fail during the status
  update to the server. Doing this is not correct according to the state
  flow, and can have unexpected consequences depending on the
  combination of Update Modules and State Scripts.
  ([MEN-4830](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4830))
* mender-inventory-network: Fix incompatibility with busybox,
  by using short command line options in grep command.
  ([MEN-4851](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4851))
* Do not put useless and sometimes even incorrect zero values
  in the configuration file when running `mender setup`.
  ([MEN-4857](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4857))

device has not rebooted.

* Fix error not finding active partition for systems where /dev/root is a symlink

* Fix a race condition which can happen during a reboot if
  systemd kills the `reboot` command before it kills the Mender client.

* Fix a (possible) file descriptor leak.
* Bump github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact to 3.5.x

### Changelogs

#### mender (2.4.1)

New changes in mender since 2.4.0:

* Add support for probing the U-Boot environment separator
([MEN-3970](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3970))
* Fix: Do not switch boot partitions on installation errors on the
active partition.
([MEN-3980](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3980))

## mender 2.4.0

_Released 09.11.2020_

### Changelogs

#### mender (2.4.0)

New changes in mender since 2.3.0:

* keystore: use openssl bindings
Switch the code that signs the server's authentication request
to use openssl. This allows to use ssl_engines, which permit to
use PKCS#11 or TPMs as keystore.
* vendor: switch openssl bindings to github.com/Linutronix/golang-openssl
spacemonkeygo/openssl depends on spacelog, which increases binary
size by about 2MB due to using reflect.
Switch to a fork which has the logger removed.
This patch can hopefully be reverted someday, when the logger
removal has been mainlined.
* Log state-script stderr as info, not error
([MEN-3316](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3316))
* mender-inventory-geo script to return geo localization data

* Switch to OpenSSL for all server communication.
([MEN-3730](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3730))
* keystore: support ed25519 keys
* Add the ability to configure the client with a client certificate and
private key in order to enable mTLS in the client communication setup.

#### mender (2.2.0)

New changes in mender since 2.2.0b1:

* Remove text/template dependency from the cli library reducing
mender client binary size by approximately 20%

New changes in mender since 2.1.2:

* mender setup cli command and new CLI package
([MEN-2418](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2418), [MEN-2806](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2806))
* Fix UBI device size calculation
* store: Save artifact provides for dependency verifications
* app: Verify artifact (version >= 3) dependencies with current artifact
* store/app{standalone}: Artifact dependency checking for artifact v3
* app/store{standalone}: Unit tests Artifact v3 depends and provides
* Enable the usage of the full Mender-Artifact version 3 format
([MEN-2642](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2642))
* support: modules-artifact-gen: Fix typo in default name of output file
* Rename --mender-professional flag to --hosted-mender
* Add --quiet flag and remove --run-daemon option and confirm device
* Now the client stores Artifact provides parameters across reboots in
standalone mode. Previously this data was ignored, and hence upgrading with an
Artifact with provides parameters these were lost.
([MEN-2969](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2969))
* Set default device type to hostname for interactive setup
* New command: `snapshot dump` to dump current rootfs
* Skip special device "rootfs" when determining rootfs type
* Report 'Unknown' rootfs type if we can't detect it
* Optimize rootfs-update image writes
([MEN-2939](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2939))
* Make `single-file-artifact-gen` script POSIX compliant.
([MEN-3049](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3049))
* Fix segfault when running `mender setup` on a read-only
filesystem.
* Fix crash when specified certificate can't be opened.
Both the `ServerCertificate` setting and the system certificates are
now optional, in the sense that the client will run without them.
However, the client will not be able to connect without the right
certificates, so the main usecase of this change is to have a workable
client that will roll back if connections can't be made, instead of
exiting. ([MEN-3047](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3047))
* Add warning message when server certificate can't be parsed.
* snapshot: Added watchdog timer to keep system from freezing
* snapshot: Add compression options to speed up transfer
* Improved error message when an update-module is missing
([MEN-3007](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3007))

## mender 2.1.1

_Released 10.23.2019_

### Changelogs

#### mender (2.1.1)

New changes in mender since 2.1.0:

* module/single-file: fix rollback state by correctly defining filename
* Check for -f option in stat command
* Set hard limit(10) for client update status report retries
This fixes an issue where the maxSendingAttemps in
updateReportRetry state could be set real high, since it is calculated
as UpdatePollIntervalSeconds / RetryPollIntervalSeconds. This adds a
hard upper limit of 10 retries for the client in any case.
([MEN-2676](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2676))

## mender 2.1.0

_Released 09.16.2019_

### Changelogs

#### mender (2.1.0)

New changes in mender since 2.0.1:

* rootfs-image-v2: Make sure to follow the spec regarding `stream-next`.
We should to read the final empty entry to make sure the client does
not block.
* Restore error code 2 behavior when there is nothing to commit.
* Fix read error masking in installer.chunkedCopy(...) func
* Update vendored dependencies for client.
* When set, HTTP proxy settings in http_proxy/https_proxy environment variables are respected now.
* module-artifact-gen: Fix inability to specify more than one device_type.
* Make all errors checked or explicitly ignored
All possible errors must be checked across all code base.
If an error is intentionally ignored it should be done explicitly.
* add state-scripts example scripts to wait for network connectivity
before trying to connect to the Mender server.
([MEN-2457](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2457))
* Artifact gen: Support argument passthrough to `mender-artifact`.
Use `--` to signal that remaining arguments should be passed directly
to `mender-artifact`.
* Make the device type file location configurable
* Make channel receiving user signals buffered
The commit fixes improper usage of signal.Notify(...) func from Go stdlib.
A channel must be buffered to properly receive signals:
https://golang.org/pkg/os/signal/#Notify
Also there is no need to reallocate channel and defer signal.Stop(...)
each time user signal is received. Thus less resources are used.
* standalone: Fix artifact committing not working after upgrading from 1.x.
([MEN-2465](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2465))
* Print warning on an invalid server certificate.
([MEN-2378](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2378))

([MEN-2457](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2457))
* Fix `/bin/lsb_release` not being picked up by inventory script.
* Fix misspells in comments and error messages
* Make sure ARM64 is included in bootloader integration inventory.
* Added example to retain systemd network configuration.
* single-file module: Make sure permissions are preserved.
Also make sure that backup preserves permissions.
* add state-script example to utilize dbus to broadcast
Mender states ([MEN-2457](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2457))
* Provide command line interface to force inventory update.
([MEN-2131](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2131))

## mender 2.0.0

_Released 05.07.2019_

### Changelogs

#### mender (2.0.0)

New changes in mender since 2.0.0b1:

* Version files are now allowed to contain a newline character. Also
some minor changes, as readVersion now accepts an io.Reader, and files are
opened outside of the function. This means that the error message is now
consistent for all the uses of readVersion.
([MEN-2318](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2318))
* file-install modules: Don't destroy original before we know we have a backup.
* Fix File Install UM to not wipe out dest_dir on single file installs
* standalone: Fix artifact committing not working after upgrading from 1.x.
([MEN-2465](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2465))
* Deprecate old file-install Update Module and create instead
two new ones: single-file-install and file-tree-install. These have a
simpler logic and clearer scope. See for details.
([MEN-2442](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2442))
* Don't push network interfaces without a mac address to inventory
* Disallow installing file trees on root destination dir for
File Install Update Module
* Make sure ARM64 is included in bootloader integration inventory.
* Mender no longer misidentifies LVM volumes.
([MEN-2302](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2302))
* Update modules: Implement `NeedsArtifactReboot` -> `Automatic`.
([MEN-2011](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2011))

New changes in mender since 1.7.0:

* Bugfix: State-script error code in Sync-Enter causes infinite loop
([MEN-2195](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2195))
* Allow rootfsPartA and rootfsPartB to be symlinks
* Rewrite AuthorizeWaitState to fix an infinite loop bug
([MEN-2195](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2195))
* Modify design for exec.Cmd stdout/stderr logging
* Place UM generator scripts in a dedicated folder
([MEN-2371](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2371))
* Write Update Module to do file(s) install
([MEN-2371](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2371))
* Set StateScriptTimeout default to 1h
([MEN-2409](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2409))
* Add source-installation instructions to README.md.
* Add `rootfs-image-v2` as a demonstration of how to
reimplement Mender's `rootfs-image` update type as an update module.
It's also useful as inspiration if users want to make their own
slightly tweaked rootfs-image type.
([MEN-2392](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2392))
* Swapped definition of StateScriptRetryTimeout and
StateScriptRetryInterval for the names to represent what they are
actually doing. This change breaks compatibility with current usage of
these configurable parameters. See documentation for correct usage.
([MEN-2409](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2409))
* Updated the copyright year to 2019 in LICENSE.
* Write update module for doing container setup
([MEN-2232](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2232))
* Add example update modules for shell commands and pkg installs.
* Remove misleading warning message when ServerCert is missing.
* Remove jq dependency for file-install Update Module
* Implement initial version of update modules.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* Add support for Mender Artifact format version 3.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* Artifact name is now stored in the local database, and
`/etc/mender/artifact_info` acts only as a fallback if no name has
been stored yet. This is typically the case for devices provisioned
directly from a disk image. Scripts should use the client
`-show-artifact` argument instead of parsing the file.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* `-rootfs` argument has been removed and replaced with the
`-install` argument, which works the same way.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* Mender now runs a stripped down set of state scripts when
installing artifacts in standalone mode, and the `-f` flag is no
longer required to install such artifacts, nor is it valid. The
scripts that run are:
* `Download` scripts
* `ArtifactInstall` scripts
* `ArtifactCommit` scripts
* `ArtifactRollback` scripts
* `ArtifactFailure` scripts
Reboot scripts do not run, so these must be handled manually in
standalone mode.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* Behavior change: `ArtifactCommit_Error` scripts now run
after an `ArtifactCommit_Leave` script has returned an error.
([MEN-2000](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2000))
* Bugfix in killing mechanism for State Scripts
timing out ([MEN-2409](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2409))
* Update vendored dependency net/http2 to latest version
* Support installing most files using Makefile `install` target.
The device_type file is not supported, since it is highly hardware
specific. Also the configuration will be very bare bones, and will
require changes unless Hosted Mender is being used.
([MEN-2383](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2383))
* Make output from `-show-artifact` easier to consume by limiting logging.
* Fix state logic for the case of actual wait
([MEN-2195](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2195))
* Properly fail the update when writes to the underlying storage fail.
([MEN-2285](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2285))
* Work around occasional OOM bug in mmc driver.
([MEN-2285](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2285))
* Make sure state directory is created if it doesn't exist.

* Fix compile for ARM64.

* Correctly fail state script execution if stderr can not be opened.
It would not be impossible to continue execution in this case, but it
is bad to lose log output, and not being able to open stderr is a
pretty uncommon case that might indicate a more serious issue like
resource starvation.
