## 5.0.0 - 2025-09-29


### Bug fixes


- Do not use world-writable permissions for mender-convert image.
 ([6a74029](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/6a7402947fecdd3d35df902b586dd0dc4bac3747)) 


  The image is only used in the build itself, so it's unlikely to be a
  security issue. It does not affect output images.
- Fix writing MSDOS partition UUIDs
([MEN-7937](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7937)) ([af0a17d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/af0a17d3ca0793fa3bc9328f98173ef4b0408144))  by @jo-lund


  rev works on unicode strings and is therefore not safe to use to swap bytes.
- Preserve extended attribute with rsync
 ([b9988ee](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/b9988eeb87fe1350fc2baae15798e796a4e1958a))  by @timbz
- Update `grub-mender-grubenv` version
([ME-458](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-458)) ([10817e5](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/10817e5e2c88d1667329b6ba865f6de04a4fd5bf))  by @lluiscampos
- Expand the data partition into the empty space on boot
([MEN-8191](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8191)) ([d04876a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/d04876acfa437454a7685ba4f59d4c13deeb8300))  by @jo-lund


  When MENDER_DATA_PART_GROWFS is "y" (which is default), x-systemd.growfs
  will be set for the data partition in /etc/fstab. This option is understood
  by systemd and will grow the file system to occupy the full block device.
  However, the partition itself will not necessarily be expanded. For
  Raspberry Pi a systemd script could be used that would run "parted"
  to expand the partition. This is now done for all systems.
- Systemd_common_config: add --fix option to parted call
 ([ef68160](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/ef6816058bfa406ca925928f177e188f838c9645))  by @chlongv


  In case when the GPT header does not include the full disk size (can
  happen to generate smaller images), parted is going to fail because of
  an exception.
  
  Add the --fix option to fix those exceptions and allow parted to resize
  the data partition.




### Documentation


- Update example commands in README
 ([f81ba6b](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/f81ba6b57acf174afc72cbac22eceeba175d0036))  by @lluiscampos


  Follow-up from 495c5e601f3cc52d152f651ff3a53aafce2b69b7
- Update command to decompress the image
 ([49f5654](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/49f565468799905dc4ba4a5beab9513f725cbf4e))  by @lluiscampos
- Rewrite comment for `MENDER_CLIENT_VERSION`
 ([0486ffb](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/0486ffbabb3c788dd5668fd54c2173dee7bd2978))  by @lluiscampos


  To clarify what `auto` will do in the context of the recently released
  Mender Client 5.0.
- Update run-tests readme
 ([d4a676d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/d4a676d5ed17024548d58c20d9fe26d2e4501bdf))  by @danielskinstad
- Extend UEFI NVRAM guide for future Ubuntu 24.04 upgrade
 ([6b787b6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/6b787b6a7606f74feab09890179dfe7df8dc98d5))  by @lluiscampos




### Features


- *(uefi)* Implement support for RPi4 `cmdline.txt` boot file.
([MEN-5826](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5826)) ([59816ee](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/59816ee8137881f5df9743ba9ebe351cbdc24baf)) 


  This is required to run the "firstboot" Raspberry Pi setup
  correctly. It also makes sure that custom boot options in that file
  are actually respected.

- Add a `platform_pre_modify` hook.
 ([9b4cae4](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/9b4cae4eb4bfdf73cd70c2ed06ca7813641ced86)) 


  This runs before modifications, but after the image has been mounted,
  so that it's ready to receive modifications.
- Introduce basic support for booting Raspberry Pi 4 using UEFI.
([MEN-5826](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5826)) ([e5fba41](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/e5fba4163ec04771f83f601b97216d784d254c14)) 


  With this we can boot Raspberry Pi 4 using UEFI, but it provides no
  integration beyond the mere boot itself, which works, but presents
  some problems. These will be fixed in upcoming commits.
- Upgrade Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image to Debian 12 64bits
([MEN-7759](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7759)) ([c4b47f3](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/c4b47f3d1523d2ba4fffc9cba5d7082b2b7f4e67))  by @lluiscampos


  This commit restores the Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image build and
  publish, but modifying it from being based in the 32bits one to the 64
  bits one.

- Create sparse images
 ([c90d8df](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/c90d8df9d719f5dbdcbc557e1338ae07d6604f00))  by @ygerlach


  Instead of allocating the whole image on the disk, only allocate the parts that actually contain data. This reduces the required disk space to store or create images.
  This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled with the `MENDER_SPARSE_IMAGE` configuration flag.
- Warn for signs of external  mender installation
 ([b4eab2a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/b4eab2aa8529df858a1cbc253b0770addff92171))  by @TheMeaningfulEngineer


- Update GRUB to version 2.12
 ([4f180a2](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/4f180a2356054b8342cf0eefa886bd602ebc99e5))  by @lluiscampos


  Following the update from `grub-mender-grubenv` repository from January
  2025:
  * https://github.com/mendersoftware/grub-mender-grubenv/pull/39
- Use the `device-components` repository
 ([150095d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/150095d717ebeea40f1993738f8d4303a2fa8864))  by @danielskinstad
- Use `apt install some-package` to install Mender packages
([MEN-8476](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8476)) ([44920dc](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/44920dca944c8bca9cc2a6ed06d3b1a3d51fc3bb))  by @vpodzime
  - **BREAKING**: apt is now used to install Mender packages from
the repositories instead of dpkg installing individual packages


  Instead of custom magic downloading and installing individual
  packages from the repos, `apt` package manager is now used to do
  its job, including dependency resolution and installation, and
  signature+checksum verification, among other things.

### Build


- Update to latest `mender-artifact` version
([MEN-8269](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8269)) ([65a3be8](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/65a3be8a94cd1a7c747c24a19de761a26ff44883))  by @lluiscampos## Bug fixes


- Do not use world-writable permissions for mender-convert image.
 ([6a74029](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/6a7402947fecdd3d35df902b586dd0dc4bac3747)) 


  The image is only used in the build itself, so it's unlikely to be a
  security issue. It does not affect output images.
- Fix writing MSDOS partition UUIDs
([MEN-7937](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7937)) ([af0a17d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/af0a17d3ca0793fa3bc9328f98173ef4b0408144))  by @jo-lund

- Update `grub-mender-grubenv` version
([ME-458](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-458)) ([10817e5](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/10817e5e2c88d1667329b6ba865f6de04a4fd5bf))  by @lluiscampos
- Expand the data partition into the empty space on boot
([MEN-8191](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8191)) ([d04876a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/d04876acfa437454a7685ba4f59d4c13deeb8300))  by @jo-lund


  When MENDER_DATA_PART_GROWFS is "y" (which is default), x-systemd.growfs
  will be set for the data partition in /etc/fstab. This option is understood
  by systemd and will grow the file system to occupy the full block device.
  However, the partition itself will not necessarily be expanded. For
  Raspberry Pi a systemd script could be used that would run "parted"
  to expand the partition. This is now done for all systems.
- Systemd_common_config: add --fix option to parted call
 ([ef68160](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/ef6816058bfa406ca925928f177e188f838c9645))  by @chlongv


  In case when the GPT header does not include the full disk size (can
  happen to generate smaller images), parted is going to fail because of
  an exception.
  
  Add the --fix option to fix those exceptions and allow parted to resize
  the data partition.

 ([49f5654](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/49f565468799905dc4ba4a5beab9513f725cbf4e))  by @lluiscampos
- Rewrite comment for `MENDER_CLIENT_VERSION`
 ([0486ffb](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/0486ffbabb3c788dd5668fd54c2173dee7bd2978))  by @lluiscampos

- Update run-tests readme
 ([d4a676d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/d4a676d5ed17024548d58c20d9fe26d2e4501bdf))  by @danielskinstad
- Extend UEFI NVRAM guide for future Ubuntu 24.04 upgrade
 ([6b787b6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/6b787b6a7606f74feab09890179dfe7df8dc98d5))  by @lluiscampos




### Features


- *(uefi)* Implement support for RPi4 `cmdline.txt` boot file.
([MEN-5826](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5826)) ([59816ee](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/59816ee8137881f5df9743ba9ebe351cbdc24baf)) 


  This is required to run the "firstboot" Raspberry Pi setup
  correctly. It also makes sure that custom boot options in that file
  are actually respected.

- Add a `platform_pre_modify` hook.
 ([9b4cae4](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/9b4cae4eb4bfdf73cd70c2ed06ca7813641ced86)) 


  This runs before modifications, but after the image has been mounted,
  so that it's ready to receive modifications.
- Introduce basic support for booting Raspberry Pi 4 using UEFI.
([MEN-5826](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5826)) ([e5fba41](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/e5fba4163ec04771f83f601b97216d784d254c14)) 


  With this we can boot Raspberry Pi 4 using UEFI, but it provides no
  integration beyond the mere boot itself, which works, but presents
  some problems. These will be fixed in upcoming commits.
- Upgrade Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image to Debian 12 64bits
([MEN-7759](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7759)) ([c4b47f3](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/c4b47f3d1523d2ba4fffc9cba5d7082b2b7f4e67))  by @lluiscampos


  This commit restores the Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image build and
  publish, but modifying it from being based in the 32bits one to the 64
  bits one.

- Create sparse images
 ([c90d8df](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/c90d8df9d719f5dbdcbc557e1338ae07d6604f00))  by @ygerlach


  Instead of allocating the whole image on the disk, only allocate the parts that actually contain data. This reduces the required disk space to store or create images.
  This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled with the `MENDER_SPARSE_IMAGE` configuration flag.
- Warn for signs of external  mender installation
 ([b4eab2a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/b4eab2aa8529df858a1cbc253b0770addff92171))  by @TheMeaningfulEngineer


- Update GRUB to version 2.12
 ([4f180a2](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/4f180a2356054b8342cf0eefa886bd602ebc99e5))  by @lluiscampos


  Following the update from `grub-mender-grubenv` repository from January
  2025:
  * https://github.com/mendersoftware/grub-mender-grubenv/pull/39
- Use the `device-components` repository
 ([150095d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/150095d717ebeea40f1993738f8d4303a2fa8864))  by @danielskinstad
- Use `apt install some-package` to install Mender packages
([MEN-8476](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8476)) ([44920dc](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-convert/commit/44920dca944c8bca9cc2a6ed06d3b1a3d51fc3bb))  by @vpodzime
  - **BREAKING**: apt is now used to install Mender packages from
the repositories instead of dpkg installing individual packages


  Instead of custom magic downloading and installing individual
  packages from the repos, `apt` package manager is now used to do
  its job, including dependency resolution and installation, and
  signature+checksum verification, among other things.

## mender-convert 4.3.0

_Released 12.18.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.3.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.2.3:

##### Bug fixes

* allow installation of deb packages with spaces
  ([MEN-7264](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7264))
* correctly check that RASPBERRYPI_OS_REQUIRED_ID is set

##### Features

* Add the possibility to install arbitrary debian packages
  located in `MENDER_INSTALL_INPUT_PACKAGES_PATH` to the converted image.
  ([MEN-7264](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7264))
* support assets directory for local data
* `mender-convert` Docker build is now architecture aware and
  it will install the native dependencies for the target architecture.
  This change makes the tool compatible with Apple arm machines. The Docker
  images will be published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.
* Added ext3 filesystem support
* make boot partition mount point configurable
* extend Raspberry Pi support to bookworm

  The Debian release 12 "bookworm" introduced the /boot/firmware
  mount point for the boot partition, which is a breaking change.

  The upgrade therefore involves these adjustments:
  - use the "check_image_os" function to check the Linux distribution
    release requirement on the supplied image
  - set MENDER_BOOT_PART_MOUNTPOINT to /boot/firmware
  - remove the /uboot directory creation and related modifications
    of scripts shipped with the supplied image.
  - copy the device tree overlays from the boot partition to /boot
    so they can be accessed from u-boot

  To facilitate maintenance, some functionality has been factored out
  into the raspberrypi_common_config file.

  Currently checks for the required Linux distribution family and version,
  e.g. "debian" and "12" (reflects "bookworm") are included. This is
  common for both the already existing 32bit and upcoming 64bit configs,
  so it prepares the version bump and aarch64 extension.

  On Debian 11 "bullseye" (or derivatives) and earlier, the boot
  partition is mounted to /uboot in the u-boot integration path.
  As several scripts rely on the files located on the patition,
  we need to adjust those.
* add support for Raspberry Pi OS 64bit

  Add support for Raspberry Pi OS 64bit, based on Debian 12
  "bookworm", including configuration for Raspberry Pi 4
  The logic is very close to the 32bit version, with the
  exceptions:
  - the kernel image filename is always kernel8.img, which
    in the supplied image is in fact a gzipped vmlinux file
  - the checks are on 64bit binaries, and the enforcement o
    32bit execution is removed.
  - No support for non-Debian images.

  Add the initial base 64b configuration and extend with
  an explicit instatiations of RPi4 "bullseye" and "bookworm"
  ([MEN-3663](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3663))
* raspberrypi_common: support local assets
* support Raspberry Pi 5, bookworm 64bit
* Upgrade Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image to Debian 12 64bits
  ([MEN-7759](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7759))
* Support for sparse images to save storage space. It is disabled by default and can be enabled with `MENDER_SPARSE_IMAGE` configuration flag

##### Other

* Remove Beaglebone from supported boards.

  Beaglebone has not worked for quite some time with the latest images,
  due to problems with booting using UEFI and GRUB. The last version
  to support it, Debian Buster, has now gone out of support, so
  therefore we remove support in mender-convert as well.
* update README for Raspberry Pi OS support
* Raspberry Pi configs have changed names. Please see the
  `README.md` files for the new names.


## mender-convert 4.2.3

_Released 12.02.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.2.3)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.2.2:

##### Bug fixes

* `docker-mender-convert` wrapper updated to support
  multiple branches pointing to the same reference and
  detached HEAD
* Modify the list of available APT distros from where to get
  Mender software by adding `debian/bookworm` and `ubuntu/noble` and
  removing `ubuntu/focal`.

##### Other

* Fallback to Debian Bullseye packages when target distribution
  is not supported, printing a user facing warning when doing so.


## mender-convert 4.2.2

_Released 06.12.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.2.2)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.2.1:

##### Bug fixes

* Make sure that `/data` mountpoint exists when using a R/O rootfs.
  ([MEN-7219](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7219))
* Fix installation of Mender client v4 when the user specifies
  the exact version to use with `MENDER_CLIENT_VERSION=a.b.c`. Using
  `auto` (default) or `latest` does not trigger this bug.

## mender-convert 4.2.1

_Released 05.16.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.2.1)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.2.0:

##### Bug fixes

* Fix occasional failure when handling service files.
  ([MEN-7143](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7143))
* Fix boot problems on RaspiOS images.
  ([MEN-7143](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7143))
* Make sure rootfs-image updates also updates the kernel.
* Fix boot failure on Ubuntu image for Raspberry Pi.
* Missing DTB inclusion in armbian-based images
* Remove incorrect warning about `64bit` ext4 flag.
  ([MEN-6027](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6027))


## mender-convert 4.2.0

_Released 03.21.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.2.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.1.1:

##### Bug fixes

* Remove unneeded `mender_grub_storage_device` assignment
  which could boot from the wrong device if a USB stick was inserted.

##### Features

* From Mender client v4 onwards, the client is distributed in
  two separate packages: `mender-auth` and `mender-update`. Now
  `mender-convert` installs these two when installing the client.
  ([MEN-6282](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6282))
* Install `mender-flash` when installing the Mender client
  ([MEN-6282](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6282))
* Switch to install packages using Debian package manager.
  This means that the files are no longer simply extracted into place,
  which has been a big source of conflict with the package manager when
  doing later upgrades. It also means that a default `mender.conf` file
  will be provided if `mender-setup` is installed, since it installs it
  by default.
  ([MEN-6935](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6935))
* Install mender-setup and mender-snapshot by default when
  Mender client 4.0 or later is selected. Previously they were built-in,
  but are now optional and can be turned off with:
  ```
  MENDER_SETUP_INSTALL=n
  MENDER_SNAPSHOT_INSTALL=n
  ```
  to save space.
  ([MEN-6935](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6935))
* add support for `MENDER_CLIENT_VERSION="auto"`, which installs the Mender Client 3.x series for Debian bullseye and buster and for Ubuntu jammy and focal, the Mender Client 4.x series for all the other distributions
  ([MEN-6976](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6976))

##### Other

* The `mender-client-data-dir.service` has been renamed to
  `mender-data-dir.service`. This is used as a dependency for the mender
  update client, and most users should not notice the change.
* Update the rpi bullseye image to the 2023-05-03 release.

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.0.2)

New changes in mender-convert since 4.0.1:

##### Bug fixes

* Remove trailing forward slash in overlay path.

  This prevented the overlay from being applied, due to duplicate slashes in the rsync command (mender-convert-modify line 280). The end result was that the /etc/mender/mender.conf file was missing from the final image. Removing the extra forward slash solved the problem.
* Fix convert error when using `MENDER_GRUB_D_INTEGRATION`
  and `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID` together.
  ([MEN-6645](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6645))

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (4.0.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 3.0.1:

##### Bug fixes

* The prebuilt Mender Grub integration now comes with the XFS module
  installed by default. ([ME-6](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-6))
* Support Mender integration in
  `raspberrypi-sys-mods/firstboot` script included in recent Raspberry Pi
  OS images by modifying the hard-coded mount point for the boot partition
  from  `/boot` to `/uboot`.
  ([MEN-5944](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5944))
* Support Mender integration in `userconf-pi/userconf-service`
  script included in recent Raspberry Pi OS images by modifying the
  hard-coded mount point for the boot partition from  `/boot` to `/uboot`.
  ([MEN-5954](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5954))
* Support Mender integration in
  `raspberrypi-net-mods/wpa_copy` script included in recent Raspberry Pi
  OS images by modifying the hard-coded mount point for the boot partition
  from  `/boot` to `/uboot`.
  ([MEN-5955](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5955))
* Supplying configs/mender_convert_demo_config as a
  --config parameter to mender-convert will add/override polling
  interval parameters on top of a mender.conf file found in the
  overlays. ([MEN-5109](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5109))
* User must now supply the overlay generated by a
  bootstrap script to mender-convert with the --overlay option in
  order for the scripts to take effect.
  Additionally, the bootstrap scripts may now be called from any
  directory. ([MEN-5109](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5109))
* Fix grub.d integration when host and target 32/64 bit
  architectures don't match. Namely: pass the correct `--target` parameter
  to `grub-install` command instead of relaying on host architecture.
  ([MEN-5979](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5979))
* grub-mender-grubenv: Add lock file to prevent data races
  when accessing boot environment concurrently.
* grub-mender-grubenv: Fail execution if both environments
  are corrupt.
* grub-mender-grubenv: Recompute checksum after restoring
  environment (new versions of grub-editenv add extra data).
* Project can now be used as a git submodule again
  Ticket: # ([MEN-6305](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6305))
* Added support for installing mender client for ubuntu jammy conversions
  Ticket: # ([MEN-6306](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6306))
* support added for mender-client deb package data archive compressed with zstd
  ([MEN-6307](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6307))

##### Features

* A bootstrap Artifact is now installed in
  /data/mender/bootstrap.mender, on every conversion, adding the ability to have
  the Mender client bootstrap the database without running an update first, thus
  enabling delta-updates to be installed without first running a full rootfs
  update. Please note that this will require a minimum of the Mender client at
  version 3.4.x. However, the generated Artifact is still usable in any case.
  ([MEN-5594](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5594))
* use a Docker volume as work area
  ([MEN-5943](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5943))

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (3.0.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 2.6.2:

* Modify `ln` calls for data store links to support successive runs
  ([MEN-5078](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5078))
* Fix "unbound variable" error when using `raspberrypi4_ubuntu_config`.
* Download and install Debian packages taking into account the
  target OS. Now downloads.mender.io serves four distributions: the two
  latests releases for Debian and Ubuntu. Probe /etc/os-release to figure
  out the correct package to install, and fallback to Debian Buster
  packages which was the previous default.
  ([MEN-5410](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5410))
* Fix installation of user specified versions for mender-configure add-on
* Debian 11 tests support.
  ([MEN-5257](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5257))
* The fstab file from the image being converted is now preserved across convertions, with the Mender specific additions merged with the existing fstab file, as opposed to replacing it completely. Which was the previous approach.
* fix compatibility of docker-mender-convert with macOS/*BSD
* Keep the UUID of the original first partition on the boot partition
  of the converted image when the partition table is GPT.
  ([MEN-5221](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5221))
* clarify supported development platforms
* clarify Raspbian compatibility
* README: add compatibility tables for configurations
* The mender-convert docker image does now contain the mender-convert application and does no longer need companion checkouts.
* All input files passed to docker-mender-convert must be located within the input directory as opposed to anywhere in the mender-convert checkout directory
* If `grub*.efi` preexists on the EFI partition, keep it
  instead of installing our own. In all other cases, we fall back to the
  old functionality of installing mender-grub and nuking the existing
  bootloader.
* Integrate with `grub.d` framework.

  This means that `grub-install` and `update-grub` no longer risk
  bricking the device, but will produce boot scripts with Mender support
  integrated. It also means that the standard GRUB menu will be
  available.

  It is supported on x86_64 platforms where `grub.d` is available, and
  can be turned on and off with `MENDER_GRUB_D_INTEGRATION`. The default
  is to use it if available.

  Devices that did not previously use `grub.d` integration won't be
  upgraded correctly with it turned on, so it is advised to set
  `MENDER_GRUB_D_INTEGRATION=n` if you are upgrading existing devices.

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (2.5.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 2.4.0:

* Switch to stable version of mender-configure.
* Always create symlinks from `/var/lib/mender-configure` to
  `/data/mender-configure`. They always need to installed in a
  rootfs-image prepared image, even if the software isn't, because if
  the package is installed later, the links must be present or it will
  act as if it is a non-rootfs image, and store the settings on the
  rootfs partition, when they should be stored on the data partition.
* Raspberry Pi: create symbolic links from /boot to /uboot for
  all existing files in boot partition. Some Raspberry Pi apps, like Pi
  Camera, expect firmware files at /boot.
  ([MEN-4658](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4658))
* Added an option `MENDER_CLIENT_INSTALL=y/n`, in order to
  configure the installation of the Mender client into the converted image.
  Defaults to `yes`.
  ([MEN-4256](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4256))
* Add a demo configuration in configs/mender_convert_demo_config which
  when added at run time creates a Mender demo setup in the converted image. This
  includes short polling intervals, and all add-on's installed by default.
  ([MEN-4462](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4462))

#### mender-convert (1.2.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 1.2.0b1:

* Update mender-convert to use Mender final release v2.1.0

New changes in mender-convert since 1.1.1:

* Expand existing environment '$PATH' variable instead of replacing it
* Use same environment '$PATH' variable when using sudo
* Fail the docker build when mandatory build-arg 'mender_client_version' is not set.
* Update Dockerfile to use latest stable mender-artifact, v2.4.0
* Use mender-artfact v3. Requires rebuild of device-image-shell container.

* Implement feature (mender-convert needs option to build without server)
([MEN-2590](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2590))
* Since mender-convert now automatically resizes the input image, there is an additional step that is executed.
* parameterize target architecture when creating Docker container
