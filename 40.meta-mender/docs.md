### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (kirkstone-v2023.02)

New changes in meta-mender since kirkstone-v2022.10:

##### Bug Fixes

* Add missing licenses checksums, set right preference, and
  correct dependencies syntax for mender-client 3.3.1 recipe
* Add missing licenses checksums, set right preference, and
  add missing license for mender-artifact 3.8.1 recipe
* Fix issues found during testing when mender-partuuid is not set
* udev: Rename blacklist to ignorelist.
* grub-mender-grubenv: Add lock file to prevent data races
  when accessing boot environment concurrently.
* grub-mender-grubenv: Fail execution if both environments
  are corrupt.

* Remove grub.efi resource files using pseudo.

##### Features

* Update UUID for all extra partitions
* Update fstab swap entry with UUID when feature is enabled
* Added variables for extra and swap parts UUID

  `rootfs-image.update-module.<UPDATE_MODULE>.version` and
  `rootfs-image.update-module.<UPDATE_MODULE>.mender_update_module`. This
  also applies to the bootstrap Artifact which gets installed on first
  boot. ([MEN-5845](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-5845))

##### Other

* Add recipe for mender-client 3.5.0
* Add recipe for mender-artifact 3.10.0

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (kirkstone-v2022.09)

New changes in meta-mender since dunfell-v2022.09:

##### Bug Fixes

* bootfiles renamed to rpi-bootfiles in upstream
  ([MEN-5689](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5689))
* Remove mender-client versions before 3.3
  ([MEN-5698](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5698))
* select buildable OpenSSL binding for mender-client
  ([MEN-5700](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5700))
* Remove lmdb recipe, which meta-openembedded/kirkstone already has.
  ([MEN-4937](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4937))
* Generate correct licenses in `$BUILDDIR/tmp/deploy/licenses`.
  ([MEN-3604](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3604))
* Make `read-only-rootfs` tweaks dependent on `mender-image` feature flag.
* Fix occasional pseudo abort issue when building certain
  images, especially in parallel. The symptom was this message:
  ```
  abort()ing pseudo client by server request.
  See https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Pseudo_Abort for more details on this
  ```
  ([MEN-5857](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5857))
* initramfs-module-install-efi: Ensure variable changes are reflected on rebuild
* bootimg: Respect MENDER_BOOT_PART_FSTYPE.
* Auto patching: Fix error `Unable to add definition
  MTDIDS_DEFAULT`, which happens on U-Boot v2020.10 and later.
* meta-mender-ci: Custom logging level for daemons with MENDER_CI_LOGLEVEL
* use mender-efi-boot feature in EFI-related overlays
* mender-core: refresh patch to be compatible with e2fsprogs 1.46.x
* core: only patch systemd-boot when mender-systemd-boot is enabled
* Adapt to new kernel which puts QEMU storage at sda, not hda.
* Fix many dangerous uses of regexes in Python.
* meta-mender-raspberrypi: update-firmware-state-script: Make
  copies of firmware binaries safer. On VFAT file-systems `mv` is not
  atomic, but still using it narrows the time window in which the files
  could be corrupted.
* rpi-bootfiles: rename to match upstream

##### Features

* Introduce `MENDER_EFI_LOADER`. This can be used to specify
  which bootloader is used to load other EFI apps, such as the grub-efi
  bootloader. This is normally provided by firmware on x86, and is
  therefore empty, but on ARM it is often set to u-boot or edk2.
* set LAYERCOMPAT to kirkstone only
  ([MEN-5681](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5681))
* mender-monitor conditionally available depending on meta-oe
* The `mender-binary-delta` recipe now takes a tarball as
  input instead of a folder containing unpacked files. Remove the line
  starting with `FILESEXTRAPATHS`, and instead insert this line:
  ```
  SRC_URI:pn-mender-binary-delta = "file://${HOME}/mender-binary-delta-1.4.0.tar.xz"
  ```
  where the path points to the downloaded tarball.
  ([MEN-4980](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4980))
* Install standard Mender Update Modules by default. These
  are:
  * deb
  * directory
  * docker
  * rpm
  * script
  * single-file
  To disable the automatic installation of these Update Modules, add
  `PACKAGECONFIG_remove = "modules"` to your `mender_%.bbappend` file,
  or set `PACKAGECONFIG` explicitly.
* Make DBus support optional in Mender client with `PACKAGECONFIG`.

  It defaults to on, but can be turned off with:

  ```
  PACKAGECONFIG_remove = "dbus"
  ```
  ([MEN-4014](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4014))
* Features that are added or removed using
  `MENDER_FEATURES_ENABLE` or `MENDER_FEATURES_DISABLE` now end up in
  the `MENDER_FEATURES` variable instead of the `DISTRO_FEATURES`
  variable. Code of the kind:
  ```
  ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'mender-uboot', 'true', 'false', d)}
  ```
  needs to change to look in `MENDER_FEATURES` instead.
* New recipe `mender-server-certificate` to install a
  self-signed Mender server certificate to be trusted by all services
  running in the device. To use it create a `.bbappend` recipe in your
  layer fetching the certificate into `file://server.crt`
  ([MEN-4273](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4273))
* meta-mender-demo: install demo server certificate with
  `mender-server-certificate` recipe to be used by `mender-client`,
  `mender-shell`, and further services that could be added.
  ([MEN-4273](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4273))
* Variable `MENDER_CERT_LOCATION` deprecated. See note about
  `mender-server-certificate` for more details
  ([MEN-4273](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4273))
* mender-server-certificate: Split concatenated certificates.

  Multiple certificates in one file are necessary to split in
  order for `update-ca-certificates` to produce a hashed symlink to
  them, which is required by some programs, such as curl.
  ([MEN-4580](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4580))
* mender-client: New native package mender-modules-gen to
  install the Mender demo Update Module Artifact generators.
  ([MEN-4671](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4671))
* grub-mender-grubenv: User space tools, "fw_printenv" and
  "fw_setenv" have been renamed to "grub-mender-grubenv-print" and
  "grub-mender-grubenv-set", respectively. This has been done in order
  to avoid conflict with U-Boot's user space tools, which have the same
  names.
* Add support for using systemd-boot with meta-mender
* Fix error message `ERROR: It's not possible to create empty
  squashfs partition 'None'` when using "squashfs" filesystem type.
  ([MEN-5285](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5285))
* use data/boot label variable
* Add feature to detect boot and data partition based on their label.
* The grub-mender-grubenv default environment location has
  moved from `/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/mender_grubenv*` to
  `/boot/efi/grub-mender-grubenv/mender_grubenv*`. This change is
  backwards compatible; existing devices will keep the environment in
  the original location and the `grub-mender-grubenv-*` tools will
  handle either location, by
  auto-detection. `/etc/mender_grubenv.config` is no longer installed by
  default, but it is still supported if installed manually.

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (dunfell-v2023.02)

New changes in meta-mender since dunfell-v2022.12:

##### Bug Fixes

* Patch `mender-artifact` _next_ recipe to be compatible with
  `dunfell` which builds with golang 1.14.
  ([MEN-6142](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-6142))
* Remove grub.efi resource files using pseudo.

##### Features

* Mender Artifacts include now information about the installed
  Update Modules in the image. Specifically, the Artifacts `provide` two
  pair of keys for each module:
  `rootfs-image.update-module.<UPDATE_MODULE>.version` and
  `rootfs-image.update-module.<UPDATE_MODULE>.mender_update_module`. This
  also applies to the bootstrap Artifact which gets installed on first
  boot. ([MEN-5845](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-5845))

##### Other

* Add recipe for mender-client 3.5.0
* Add recipe for mender-artifact 3.10.0
* Add recipe for mender-gateway 1.1.0

New changes in meta-mender since dunfell-v2022.11:

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix the regression in which Dunfell started providing the 3.3.x
  client as the default. This was an unintentional change, and this
  re-downprioritizes it, so that the `2.x` client is once again the default.
  ([MEN-6122](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6122))

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (dunfell-v2022.09)

New changes in meta-mender since dunfell-v2022.04:

##### Bug Fixes

* Add mender-artifact 3.7.1 recipe.
* Force building in separate build directory, even with `externalsrc`.
* Automatically rebuild is tags have changed.
* Make mender-client-resize-data-part compatible with "partuuid" setups.
  ([MEN-3701](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3701))
* Race condition in mender-client-resize-data-part
  ([MEN-5717](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5717))
* Added mender-configure-module 1.0.4
* Better error message when Enterprise components can't be found.
* Add a systemd Before dependency on the `mender-client-data-dir`
  service file.
* repeated grub build with different MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE

  If a variable in do_configure task changed do_configure task is triggered
  again but not do_compile.This patch clean the build folder and triggered
  do_compile task again to get a fresh grub.cfg file with the fresh generated
  data from do_configure task.

##### Features

* Add mender-artifact version 3.8.0.
* add the mender-client 3.3.0 recipe
* Add the mender-monitor 1.2.0 recipe
* Add the mender-gateway 1.0.0 recipe
* Add recipe for mender-binary-delta 1.4.0
* Implemented proper license tracking for commercial
  components. This was necessary for several reasons:
  * Licenses were not being correctly generated inside
    `$BUILDDIR/tmp/deploy/licenses`.
  * Because they were not generated correctly, it wasn't previously
    possible to bind a particular version of a commercial component to
    a specific license. Hence, if Northern.tech were to change the
    license, this online version would be the only available copy. It
    thus would become unclear exactly what terms the user had accepted.
    This has been fixed by including the license with the software.
  This requires all users to re-accept the license (the license text can
  be found in
  `meta-mender-commercial/files/licenses/Mender-Yocto-Layer-License.md`),
  by adding this to their `local.conf`:
  ```
  LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED:append = " commercial_mender-yocto-layer-license"
  ```
  Previous assignments of `LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED` mentioning "mender"
  software can be removed.
  ([MEN-5517](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5517))
* mender-artifact: Add OpenSSL dependency
  ([MEN-5759](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5759))

##### Other

* dataimg: Load Mender files on F2FS

  Bug fix to load Mender configuration files to the data partition
  when using F2FS through sload.f2fs.
* mender-part-images: f2fs-tools-native if using F2FS

  Add a dependency to f2fs-tools-native if using F2FS for the data
  partition.

  ```

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (warrior-v2021.04)

New changes in meta-mender since warrior-v2021.02:

* Fix Mender installation from a USB stick for BIOS
* Fixes build warnings: "MENDER_CONNECT_..." is not a
  recognized MENDER_ variable
* mender-connect.conf: Remove unnecessary field ServerURL
* Include a recipe for building dosfstools 4.2
  This is due to an error in older versions, which can leave the Vfat boot
  partitions bricked.
  See for more information.
  ([MEN-4497](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4497))
* Add mender-configure git recipe
  ([MEN-4420](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4420))
* Add mender-configure-scripts package, which provides
  timezone configuration out of the box.
* Add mender-configure-demo package, which provides led
  manipulation on Raspberry Pi devices, for demo purposes.
* If the `mender-systemd` class is set (the default),
  mender-configure now provides a service file for systemd which will
  automatically apply the stored configuration on startup.
* Prepopulate the device config in mender-configure-demo.
  ([MEN-4594](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4594))
* mender-client: Split concatenated certificates in ca-certificates.
  Multiple certificates in one file are necessary to split in
  order for `update-ca-certificates` to produce a hashed symlink to
  them, which is required by some programs, such as curl.
  ([MEN-4580](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4580))
* Add mender 2.6.0.
* Add mender-connect 1.1.0.
* Add mender-artifact 3.5.1.
* Add mender-configure 1.0.0.
* Add mender 2.5.1

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (zeus-v2020.12)

New changes in meta-mender since zeus-v2020.10:

* Disable filesystem journal on read-only-rootfs, which
sometimes causes unstable rootfs checksum together with fsck.
([MEN-3912](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3912))
* mender: Fix broken patch for mender-systemd-machine-id.
* Remove recipe mender-client 2.3.0
* Add recipe mender-client 2.3.1
* Remove recipe mender-client 2.4.0
* Add recipe mender-client 2.4.1
* New Mender-client configuration option: 'inventory-network-scripts'.
This option, if enabled, installs the inventory-network-scripts in the client.
This is enabled as an option, because the inventory-geo script relies on a
third-party network service to figure out the geographic location of the device,
which may not be something that everyone wants installed on their devices. The
feature is enabled in the standard 'PACKAGECONFIG' for the Mender-client, and is
included unless overridded. To remove it, add
'PACKAGECONFIG_remove_pn-mender-client = "inventory-network-scripts"' to your
local.conf file.
* mender-client: Do not keep resizing if a little space is left unused
([MEN-4176](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4176))
* mender-client: Ensure growfs works on GPT filesystems
([MEN-4176](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4176))

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (warrior-v2020.12)

New changes in meta-mender since warrior-v2020.10:

* Disable `64bit` ext4 filesystem feature.
([MEN-3513](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3513))
* Disable filesystem journal on read-only-rootfs, which
sometimes causes unstable rootfs checksum together with fsck.
([MEN-3912](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3912))
* mender: Fix broken patch for mender-systemd-machine-id.
* Remove recipe mender-client 2.3.0
* Add recipe mender-client 2.3.1
* Remove recipe mender-client 2.4.0
* Add recipe mender-client 2.4.1
* New Mender-client configuration option: 'inventory-network-scripts'.
This option, if enabled, installs the inventory-network-scripts in the client.
This is enabled as an option, because the inventory-geo script relies on a
third-party network service to figure out the geographic location of the device,
which may not be something that everyone wants installed on their devices. The
feature is enabled in the standard 'PACKAGECONFIG' for the Mender-client, and is
included unless overridded. To remove it, add
'PACKAGECONFIG_remove_pn-mender-client = "inventory-network-scripts"' to your
local.conf file.
* mender-client: Do not keep resizing if a little space is left unused
([MEN-4176](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4176))
* mender-client: Ensure growfs works on GPT filesystems
([MEN-4176](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4176))
* mender-client: Update LICENSE to include OpenSSL
* Add a recipe for building 'mender-connect', remote shell support.
([MEN-4083](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4083))
* meta-mender-demo: install mender-connect

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (dunfell-v2020.12)

New changes in meta-mender since dunfell-v2020.11:

* mender: Reestablish labels on the root filesystems.
* New Mender-client configuration option: 'inventory-network-scripts'.
This option, if enabled, installs the inventory-network-scripts in the client.
This is enabled as an option, because the inventory-geo script relies on a
third-party network service to figure out the geographic location of the device,
which may not be something that everyone wants installed on their devices. The
feature is enabled in the standard 'PACKAGECONFIG' for the Mender-client, and is
included unless overridded. To remove it, add
'PACKAGECONFIG_remove_pn-mender-client = "inventory-network-scripts"' to your

* mender-client: Update LICENSE to include OpenSSL
* mender-client: Include OpenSSL license from 2.4.x onwards.
* Add a recipe for building 'mender-connect', remote shell support.
([MEN-4083](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-4083))
* Fix a parsing issue where `inherit` could not be used with
variables that had been defined with overrides that depended on
`MENDER_FEATURES_ENABLE`. One example would be:
```
MYVAR_mender-grub = "grub-efi"
inherit ${MYVAR}
```

New changes in meta-mender since zeus-v2020.06:

* uboot_auto_configure: build U-Boot the same way Yocto does
* Fix error message about `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` being wrong,
such as:
```
ERROR: u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided-1.0-r0 do_configure: U-Boot configuration rpi_4_config has setting:
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x400000
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND=0x800000
but Mender expects:
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x800000
Please fix U-Boot’s configuration file.
```
* add support for separate A/B kernel partitions
* Add MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS_SIZES_MB variable
* U-Boot auto-configuration: Better algorithm for removing
options from defconfig files. This increases board compatibility.
* Start using libubootenv for U-Boot environment manipulation.
This deprecates the u-boot-fw-utils tools, which have been removed
from upstream. The functionality and command line API is the same.
* `libubootenv` is now used instead of `u-boot-fw-utils`. If
you have a "fw-utils" type recipe in your layer, you probably need to
remove it, particularly if it references `u-boot-mender-common.inc`.
* Patch broken UBI support in libubootenv_0.2.
* chmod 600 on mender.conf
([MEN-3762](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3762))
* Add mender-2.2.1 and mender-artifact-3.3.1 recipes.
* Add mender-2.3.0 and mender-artifact-3.4.0 recipes.
* Add mender-binary-delta-1.1.0 release.
* Remove mender-client recipes that are incompatible with dunfell.
([MEN-3764](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3764))
* Fix incorrect BOOTENV_SIZE value being used in libubootenv
recipe. The symptom of this was a non-working set of `fw_printenv` and
`fw_setenv` tools:
```
root@raspberrypi4:~# fw_printenv
Cannot read environment, using default
Cannot read default environment from file
```
([MEN-3834](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3834))
* Fix fsck running on every boot in dunfell.

* Fix failure in boot log when `MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` is used.
`mender-growfs-data` and `MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` are mutually exclusive,
so set the default of `mender-growfs-data` to off if
`MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` is being used.
* Improve warning when multiple DTB files are in KERNEL_DEVICETREE

This will help when not using `mender-grub`, and instead using
Barebox, for example.
* Make sure partitions are marked for fsck'ing by default.
* Follow e2fsprogs version bump from 1.44 to 1.45.
* Follow systemd feature rename from time-epoch to set-time-epoch.
* systemd-conf: Fix missing FILES section which is mandatory on zeus.
* Work around missing LSB support in zeus.
This is a very intrusive change, which creates the `/lib64` symlink on
the root filesystem for 64-bit systems. This symlink is normally
missing when building with Yocto, but was provided by the LSB package
previously. The directory is necessary to remain compatible with
software built outside of Yocto. The Mender demo artifact, as well as
the binary delta update module are examples of such components.
If the link turns out to conflict with another package, it should be
possible to work around the problem by adding this to the other
package, either in the original `.bb` file or a `.bbappend` file:
```
RPROVIDES_${PN} += "lsb-ld"
```
* Enable CONFIG_EFI_STUB on kernels when booting with UEFI on ARM.
* Add mender 2.2.0 recipe and remove beta
* Add mender-artifact 3.3.0 recipe and remove beta
* Add mender 2.1.3 recipe
* raspberrypi4: update U-Boot patches to apply to 2019.07 version
([MEN-3262](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3262))
* Renamed mender -> mender-client
This renaming was done to conform with the new naming introduced. This helps
seperate Mender (the product), from Mender-client, which is a part of the
aforementioned product.
The renaming is due in parts:
* The 'mender.service' systemd recipe is now named 'mender-client.service'
* The bitbake recipes are now renamed from 'mender%.bb' to 'mender-client%.bb'
* The Mender feature 'mender-install' is now 'mender-client-install'
* The mender directory holding the mender-client recipe is also renamed 'mender-client'
* Upgrade to U-Boot 2020.01 and GRUB 2.04 to fix Beaglebone support.
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
([MEN-3251](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3251))
* mender-grub: Dynamically determine mender_grub_storage_device.
* mender-grub: Add regexp module.
* Deprecate MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE variable.
* raspberrypi: add state script to update boot firmware
Raspberry Pi boards have a set of boot firmware files that are
located on the vfat boot part, and these files are not updated
when you perform an update of the root filesystem.
Occasionally there will be changes to the Raspberry Pi software stack
that requires that these files are update. Typically there is something
in the Linux kernel that requires something that is in the boot
firmware. This means that to update the Linux kernel you must also
update the boot firmware files.
Above is really sub-optimal design of the Raspberry Pi boards but a
limitation that we must live with.
Note that the DTB files are also part of "boot firmware" and included in
the state script update.
The provided state-script can be enabled by adding the following to e.g
local.conf:
INHERIT += "rpi-update-firmware"
The ArtifactInstall_Leave_50 script can be overriden to customize what
files to update, e.g only DTB files. By default all files on the boot
part will be updated including config.txt and cmdline.txt.
NOTE! Updating the boot firmware files can not be done atomically and the
files are not roll-backed even though an rootfs rollback is performed. Conclusion,
this is an risky operating which could brick your device.
* Fix infinite loop which would eat all available memory
on the build host, when using U-Boot v2020.01 or later together with
the auto-patcher.
([MEN-3265](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3265))
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
([MEN-3251](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3251))
* mender: Add sanity check for partuuid and uboot.
* grubenv: Handle debug command prompt when running as EFI
app.
* write GPT partition table before resize of data part
([MEN-3366](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3366))
* raspberrypi: busybox compatibility for boot firmware state script
* grub: Move dynamic storage handling into grub-mender-grubenv repository.
* U-Boot versions from v2020.01 onwards have moved several C
code defines into Kconfig, which may require changes in board specific
patches. Specifically, `CONFIG_ENV_SIZE`, `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` and
`CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND` now need to be defined in the board's
`defconfig` file. In addition, the redundant environment now need to
be specifically enabled, using the new switch,
`CONFIG_SYS_REDUNAND_ENVIRONMENT`. If you are using
`MENDER_UBOOT_AUTO_CONFIGURE=1`, then this is handled automatically,
but if not you will need to add this to your board's `defconfig` file:
```
CONFIG_SYS_REDUNAND_ENVIRONMENT=y
CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x20000
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x800000
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND=0x1000000
```
Note that the values may differ from the values you actually need,
these are just the defaults from the meta-mender Yocto
layer. `CONFIG_ENV_SIZE` need to match the `MENDER_ENV_SIZE` Bitbake
variable, and `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` and `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND`
should (usually) be 1x and 2x the `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`
variable. If the values are not as expected, then you will get an
error during the compile stage.
* Fix OOM issue on the build host if certain configuration
options are missing from the defconfig file.
([MEN-3476](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3476))
* grub-mender-grubenv: Remove kernel_devicetree.
The only way to use GRUB 2.04 on ARM is via UEFI, and the
kernel_devicetree information is not used when loading via UEFI,
instead it is queried directly from the UEFI provider.
* Make sure that mender-grow-data.service only runs once.
* Boot no longer blocks while the data part is resized, and
instead this is a background process.
* Add OpenSSL as dependency for Git versions of the Mender client.
* Fix U-Boot auto-patcher sometimes adding two conflicting
options to the defconfig file.
([MEN-3514](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3514))
* Add mender-client_2.3.0b1 and mender-artifact_3.4.0b1 recipes.
To use the Beta recipes, add this to `local.conf`:
```
PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-client = "2.3.0b1"
PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-artifact = "3.4.0b1"
PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-artifact-native = "3.4.0b1"
```
* Add mender-binary-delta_1.1.0b1 recipe.
To use the beta, add this to `local.conf`:
```
PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-binary-delta = "1.1.0b1"

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (warrior-v2020.04)

New changes in meta-mender since warrior-v2020.03:

* mender-grub: Dynamically determine mender_grub_storage_device.
* mender-grub: Add regexp module.
* Deprecate MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE variable.
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
([MEN-3251](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3251))
* raspberrypi: add state script to update boot firmware
Raspberry Pi boards have a set of boot firmware files that are
located on the vfat boot part, and these files are not updated
when you perform an update of the root filesystem.
Occasionally there will be changes to the Raspberry Pi software stack
that requires that these files are update. Typically there is something
in the Linux kernel that requires something that is in the boot
firmware. This means that to update the Linux kernel you must also
update the boot firmware files.
Above is really sub-optimal design of the Raspberry Pi boards but a
limitation that we must live with.
Note that the DTB files are also part of "boot firmware" and included in
the state script update.
The provided state-script can be enabled by adding the following to e.g
local.conf:
INHERIT += "rpi-update-firmware"
The ArtifactInstall_Leave_50 script can be overriden to customize what
files to update, e.g only DTB files. By default all files on the boot
part will be updated including config.txt and cmdline.txt.
NOTE! Updating the boot firmware files can not be done atomically and the
files are not roll-backed even though an rootfs rollback is performed. Conclusion,
this is an risky operating which could brick your device.

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (thud-v2018.12)

New changes in meta-mender since sumo-v2018.11.2:

* Add mender-artifact 2.4.0b1 recipe.
* Make mkfs.ubifs and ubinize arguments a bit more customizable.
The new variables `MENDER_FLASH_MINIMUM_IO_UNIT` and
`MENDER_MAXIMUM_LEB_COUNT` have been introduced, which maps directly
to the corresponding arguments of the two tools.
* Beaglebone builds no longer compatible with builds from sumo and older.
The reason is that bootloader switched to GRUB. The old build type can
be restored by removing `mender-grub` and adding `mender-uboot` to
`DISTRO_FEATURES` using the `MENDER_FEATURES` variables.
* Fix `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXCLUDE_PATH` failing when listing a non-existent path.
* Increase default u-boot MTD partition size to 1MiB.
* Fix inability to patch old u-boot variants of MTDPARTS and
MTDIDS correctly.
([MEN-1849](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1849))
* Add mender 1.7.0b1 recipe.
* Fix images not being modifiable by mender-artifact in thud and later.
* Add mender 1.5.1 recipe.
* Add mender 1.6.0 recipe.
* Add mender-artifact 2.3.0 recipe.
* Remove support for `loadaddr` variable and
`CONFIG_LOADADDR` config setting in U-Boot. This only affects boards
that use U-Boot as a first stage bootloader in order to use UEFI to
load GRUB as the second stage bootloader. For most boards it should
not be problematic, since most support `kernel_addr_r`. If there is
a problem however, it might be necessary to forward port [this
patch](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender/blob/b39aa8aeecdf2b8cce3dbcce25ec044073568348/meta-mender-core/recipes-bsp/u-boot/patches/0007-distro_bootcmd-Switch-bootefi-to-use-loadaddr-by-def.patch)
to the U-Boot version in question.
* Fix boot directory being excluded from thud images
* Add some debug functionality to GRUB booting process.
To use it, enable either or both of `debug-log` and `debug-pause` in
`PACKAGECONFIG` for `grub-mender-grubenv`. The former enables debug
logging in GRUB, which can be tweaked further by setting the
`DEBUG_LOG_CATEGORY` variable. The latter pauses the boot process at
strategic points during the boot, so that screen output can be
captured before it is cleared or scrolls by.
* Fix build error when using any hard drive besides sda/hda, such as sdb.
* Images partitioned with GPT or MSDOS partition tables are
now padded up to the nearest alignment specified in
`MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`. Previously the last block might be
shorter.
* Remove meta-mender-orangepi and meta-mender-toradex-nxp
as these will be moved to meta-mender-community for the next stable
branch (thud)
* Make sure mtdimg is not truncated, but has its full length.
* Enable EXTERNALSRC to be used with u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided.
* Allow disabling auto-generated /etc/fstab
* mender: Enable systemd in mender-systemd FEATURE handling.
As long as `mender-systemd` feature is enabled, it is no longer
necessary to include the block:
```
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
```
* Add canary value to U-Boot env to catch bootloader/user-space mismatch.
* GRUB: Fix error about devicetree command not being found.
* Change default storage on x86 to memory card (mmcblk0).
* Reduce partitioning overhead by default.
The current value of 4 * alignment is excessive, since we now take
alignment into account when calculating rootfs size. Instead, only
count overhead lost to partition table, which is 2 * alignment.
* mender: Allow overrides for MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB_DEFAULT.
* Allow boot partition to be populated with normal package recipes.
* Fix `MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE` variable not being respected.
([MEN-2048](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2048))
* GRUB: Make kernel console argument configurable using "console_bootargs".
One can set this variable in some "xx_*_grub.cfg" script with an index
lower than 10, in the grub-mender-grubenv recipe.
* uboot_auto_patch: Switch kernel address from `loadaddr`
back to `kernel_addr_r`. This was discussed with U-Boot developers and
is the proper address variable going forward.
* Fix incorrect Flash bad PEB calculation which led to wrong total image size.
([MEN-1849](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1849))
* Add mender 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 recipes.
* Add mender-artifact 2.3.1 and 2.4.0 recipes.
* Auto-select correct `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE_BASE` scheme.
This should rarely need to be set by anyone anymore.
* Fix confusing warning flood when MENDER_MTDIDS is unset in a UBI build.
* Switch image names from containing `MACHINE` to containing
`MENDER_DEVICE_TYPE`. So for example, if you have a build for the
raspberrypi3 machine type, with device type of "prod_rpi3", the image
will now be called `core-image-minimal-prod_rpi3.sdimg` instead of
`core-image-minimal-raspberrypi3.sdimg`.
* Fix console logging for systemd on QEMU.
* Fix build error when using GRUB and /dev/mmcblk storage device.
* Add specific patches for u-boot-toradex_2016.11.
([MEN-1849](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1849))
* grub: Remove restriction that the core.img be at sector 1
* mender-uboot: Use hex for dev/part numbers in U-Boot.
* Delete all components from pre-1.5 Mender releases.
Remove Mender 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 and Mender artifact 2.2.0.
* Introduce support for a standardized boot method on ARM
using UEFI and GRUB. The UEFI boot standard is fully supported on ARM
in theory, but few board manufacturers implement it in practice.
Therefore U-Boot is still utilized, but acts only as a UEFI loader,
and hence no U-Boot integration is needed. All boot scripts are then
handled by GRUB, which needs no patching.
([MEN-1595](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1595), [MEN-1659](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1659))
* Add support for PARTUUID in grub-mender-grubenv script.
* Remove colibri-imx7-mender MACHINE type, replaced by colibri-imx7.
* Fix regression that removed boot flag from boot partition.
* Fix regression that caused Beaglebone to not boot.
* QEMU: Always try to run with KVM enabled, only fall back to emulation.
* Fix license checksum sometimes failing in
`u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided` recipe when U-Boot fork has a
slightly different README file.
* Add PARTUUID generation and integration
* Change default bootloader to GRUB on all non-UBI platforms.
U-Boot will still be used on ARM platforms to provide UEFI that GRUB
can use, but it will not be used for Mender integration. To opt out,
and keep using traditional U-Boot integration, remove `mender-grub`,
and add `mender-uboot` using the `MENDER_FEATURES` variables.
* Fixed support for raspberrypi3-64 and aarch64
* mender-uboot: Allow multi-digit partition/device nums.
* Add mender 1.6.0b1 and mender-artifact 2.3.0b1 recipes.
* Remove obsolete mender pre-1.4 and mender-artifact pre-2.2 recipes.
* Fix regression in QEMU launching after changing image name in 897195ddc3f.
* Replaced default yocto cfg file for grub pre configuration by the proper cfg file without redundant and erroneous search command.
* rpi: update U-boot patch to get rid of warning
* Fix incorrect license tag for mender-artifact recipe.
Little practical difference, since they are all permissive licenses.
* Fix missing wpa_supplicant in Raspberry Pi demo images.
* GRUB: Pass kernel arguments from bootargs variable instead of hard coded.
This allows it to be overridden or modified by adding a script snippet
which sets the variable.
Also log kernel messages to both screen and serial port by default,
and have systemd log to serial port (last "console" argument,
apparently it cannot log to both).
* Add support for GPT BIOS images
* Boot script recipe for demoing OTA updates

## meta-mender sumo-v2018.07

_Released 07.12.2018_

#### meta-mender (sumo-v2018.07)
* Warn when mender.conf settings conflict with Bitbake variables.
* Make sure that new-style "enp" network devices get DHCP address in demo.
* Delete all components from pre-1.3 Mender releases.
All pre-1.3 releases are EOL.
* Rename IMAGE_BOOTLOADER* variables to MENDER_IMAGE_BOOTLOADER*.
* Fix lockfile error due to using system lock directory.
* Licence checksum updated in mender-artifact
* mender: Allow for forcing a specific KERNEL_IMAGETYPE.
* mender-uboot: Add MENDER_UBOOT_POST_SETUP_COMMANDS config point.
* Fix occasional inode corruption issue when re-launching a
previously launched and saved QEMU image.
* QEMU: Limit client setup steps to run on first boot only.
* mender-qemu: increase qemu memory size to 256MiB.
* Let colibri-imx7 and vf boards be handled by automatic patching.
* Fixed issue with build due to unknown image linux-firmware-raspbian-bcm43430
* Fix mender not building if build and host architecture is the same.
* meta-mender-orangepi: Fix up u-boot
* Fix Linux kernel hanging when loaded via U-Boot/UEFI/GRUB
on vexpress-qemu*.
([MEN-1657](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1657))
* Add mender-1.3.1 and mender-artifact-2.1.2 recipes.
* Implement `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXCLUDE_PATH` support. It works the
following way: It contains a space separated list of directories,
relative to the rootfs root (no beginning slash), and any directory
specified will be omitted from the rootfs. If the directory ends in a
slash, only the contents will be omitted, not the directory itself
(useful for mount points). One can then set
`do_image_<imagetype>[respect_exclude_path] = "1"` for certain image
builders to prevent the exclusion and then add them back as separate
partitions there.
* Support for `MENDER_DATA_PART_DIR` has been removed. Use
recipe files to add files directly to the `/data` directory instead.
* mender: Create bmap files.
* tests: Filter out the data partition as the latest build artifact.
* example-state-scripts: Explicitly return 0 from scripts.
* uboot_auto_patch: Simplify definition placement at the expense of beauty.
The resulting patch is uglier because the definitions go into a cross
platform section which is not appropriate for upstream submission. But
it does fix the case where unwanted ifdefs were "hiding" the added
definitions.
* rpi_0_w: Setup Mender required defconfigs
* Implement GRUB and x86-64 support.
([MEN-1430](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1430), [MEN-1432](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1432), [MEN-1433](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1433), [MEN-1434](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1434), [MEN-1435](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1435), [MEN-1436](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1436))
* Implement qemux86-64 machine target.
([MEN-1430](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1430), [MEN-1432](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1432), [MEN-1433](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1433), [MEN-1434](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1434), [MEN-1435](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1435), [MEN-1436](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1436))
* mender: Conditionally add /uboot mount only for SDCards.
* Increased the demo mender-retry-polling interval
([MEN-1006](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1006))
* meta-mender-toradex-nxp: Adapt colibri-imx7-mender to U-Boot autopatching
* Fix 'depends upon non-existent task' error in U-Boot recipes without auto patching.
* Use timedatectl, if available, to determine with time is synchronized.
* mender upgraded to 1.4.0.
* mender-artifact upgraded to 2.2.0.
* mender-qemu: More robust detection of MACHINE setting.
* beaglebone: Rename to beaglebone-yocto.
* Add mtdimg image type.
The mtdimg type is an image type meant to be flashed to the entire
Flash device, unlike the ubimg, which should only be flashed to the
ubi area of the mtd device. Either one can be used depending on need.
vexpress-nor image, used in QEMU, was also changed to take advantage
of the new mtdimg image.
([MEN-1597](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1597))
* Add LAYERSERIES_COMPAT settings to all Mender layers.
* Replace `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_KB` with
`MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`, which is in bytes.
* Rename `MENDER_STORAGE_RESERVED_RAW_SPACE` to
`MENDER_RESERVED_SPACE_BOOTLOADER_DATA`, to better reflect what it is
used for.
* Enable wifi in the raspberry-pi demo image by default.
([MEN-1804](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1804))
* mender: Only create vfat boot partition if size is non-zero
* meta-mender-toradex-nxp: increase layer priority to 91
* Fix creating ubifs image.
* tests: Respect user set SSTATE_DIR and DL_DIR variables.
* Make sure auto provided fw-utils use virtual/bootloader setting if present.
* QEMU: Raise systemd service timeout so that it boots properly on slow hosts.
* Fix fstab sometimes not containing boot partition entry.
* Fix build error if `IMAGE_FSTYPES` contains the same entry more than once.
* Implement x86 BIOS support together with GRUB.
It can be enabled by inheriting the `mender-full-bios` class, or by
enabling the `mender-grub` and `mender-bios` features using
`MENDER_FEATURES_ENABLE`.
([MEN-1845](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1845))
* Client container init scripts are modified to accept MAC address for qemu through env var, `RANDOM_MAC`.
* added layer dependency on mender layer
* uboot_auto_configure: Fail immediately if a define cannot be added.
Better than failing later at runtime, where the problem is much harder
to debug.
* Warn on unused MENDER_.* variables
([MEN-1603](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1603))
* uboot_auto_patch: Switch kernel address from `kernel_addr_r` to `loadaddr`.
* Remove unused IMAGE_UENV_TXT_FILE variable.
* Add U-Boot auto patching support for Flash based devices.
The autopatcher will use UBI as storage medium for both the
filesystems and the U-Boot environment. Mender requires a minimum of
configuration: the `MENDER_MTDIDS` needs to be set for the board, and
will normally go in the `conf/machine/<MACHINE>.conf` file for the
board in question. See documentation for variables `MENDER_MTDIDS`,
`MENDER_IS_IN_MTDID` and `MENDER_MTDPARTS` for more information.
([MEN-1597](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1597))
* Partition alignment (`MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`) on Flash
devices using UBI is now aligned to the UBI LEB size, which in general
is not a multiple of KiB.
([MEN-1597](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1597))
* Add Mender 1.4.1 recipe.
* Clear IMAGE_NAME_SUFFIX for all image types.
* Fix "No rule to make target 'envtools'" error in some U-Boot builds.
* Pregenerate SSH keys for all QEMU images.
* Since the "beaglebone" machine name has changed in upstream
to "beaglebone-yocto", add "beaglebone" to the
`MENDER_DEVICE_TYPES_COMPATIBLE` default, so that older devices can
upgrade even if they have the old device type.
* mender: Copy data partition images to the deploy dir.
* mender: Append to fstab rather than replacing it.
* Fix failed uboot.env install when mender-uboot feature is disabled.
* tests: Also check ARTIFACTIMG_FSTYPE for compatible images.
* uboot_auto_patch: Update to support U-Boot v2018.05.
* uboot_auto_patch: Add support for new Kconfig based
defines.
* mender-uboot: Add MENDER_UBOOT_PRE_SETUP_COMMANDS config point.
* Add Mender 1.5.0 Beta recipe.
* Add mender-1.4.0b1 and mender-artifact-2.2.0b1 recipes.
* Add 'dataimg' as an image type.
It contains the data partition filesystem which is normally part of
the complete partitioned image. To enable it, add `dataimg` to
`IMAGE_FSTYPES`.
([MEN-1879](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1879))
* mender: Use only the basename to load DTBs.
* Add Mender 1.5.0 recipe.
* Document SDIMG_ROOTFS_TYPE settings for Raspberry Pi.
* Change rootfs size calculation so it takes alignment into account.
This should fix a few corner cases, where the filesystems may all fit
in terms of bytes, but still would not actually fit because of
partition alignment.
* Added new state script to wait for time sync to complete.
* Drop creation of `authtentoken` file, which is unneeded now.
* Added basic support for orangepi boards
* mender: Cleanup IMAGE_FSTYPES.
* uboot_auto_configure: Handle tabs in defines correctly.

It can be turned on and off by setting `MENDER_UBOOT_AUTO_CONFIGURE`
to `1` and `0`, respectively, in a `u-boot.bbappend` file. It is on by
default. If the automatic patching is unsuccessful, there is a special
bitbake target that can be used to extract the generated patch and use
it as a basis for a manual patch. It can be invoked with `bitbake -c
save_mender_auto_configured_patch <u-boot-recipe>`, where
`<u-boot-recipe>` is either `u-boot` or the fork of U-Boot that your
board uses. ([MEN-1387](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1387))
