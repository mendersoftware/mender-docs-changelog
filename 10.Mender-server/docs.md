#### useradm (1.19.0)

New changes in useradm since 1.18.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* delete user tokens when deleting user
* Make username/email case-insensitive

  This commit forces the internal representation of the username/email
  addresses to be lowercase. This means that any users that signed up with
  an email containing uppercase characters will be locked out from their
  account. To fix this issue, the server maintainer should run the
  following mongodb migration script:
  ```
  let tAdm = db.getSiblingDB("tenantadm");
  tAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.name.toLowerCase() != doc.name) {
      print(
        "Converting to lower case (<tenantid>/<userid>): " +
          doc.tenant_id +
          "/" +
          doc._id
      );
      tAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { name: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
      let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm-" + doc.tenant_id);
      usrAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }
  });
  let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm");
  usrAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.email.toLowerCase() != doc.email) {
      print("Converting to lower case (<userid>):" + doc._id);
      usrAdm.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.email.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }
  });
  ```

#### useradm-enterprise (1.19.0)

New changes in useradm-enterprise since 1.18.0:

##### Bug Fixes

* delete user tokens when deleting user
* Make username/email case-insensitive

  This commit forces the internal representation of the username/email
  addresses to be lowercase. This means that any users that signed up with
  an email containing uppercase characters will be locked out from their
  account. To fix this issue, the server maintainer should run the
  following mongodb migration script:
  ```
  let tAdm = db.getSiblingDB("tenantadm");
  tAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.name.toLowerCase() != doc.name) {
      print(
        "Converting to lower case (<tenantid>/<userid>): " +
          doc.tenant_id +
          "/" +
          doc._id
      );
      tAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { name: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
      let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm-" + doc.tenant_id);
      usrAdm.users.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.name.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }
  });
  let usrAdm = db.getSiblingDB("useradm");
  usrAdm.users.find({}).forEach((doc) => {
    if (doc.email.toLowerCase() != doc.email) {
      print("Converting to lower case (<userid>):" + doc._id);
      usrAdm.updateOne(
        { _id: doc._id },
        { $set: { email: doc.email.toLowerCase() } }
      );
    }
  });

#### deployments-enterprise (1.9.0)

New changes in deployments-enterprise since 1.8.1:

* Disallow empty batches in phased rollouts
Previously there was a possibility to end up with an empty batch, due
to the formula used in the calculation for the number of devices which
is based on extracting a percentage number of devices from the total. Thus
if the total is so small, that a percentage below some number rounds to zero,
the batch would be empty. Now that same input will return an error.
([MEN-2810](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2810))

where `$USERNAME` is the username given to you from Northern.tech. You
will be prompted for the password.
* Verify that empty batches returns a 400 error
Added a test for verifying that deployments-enterprise returns a 400 error
in case of the number of devices in a batch being empty due to rounding
errors in relation to the formula used for determining the number of devices
in a batch. ([MEN-2838](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2838))
* Backend Integration tests always print "tests failed"; fix.
* Remove the Python dependency in the demo script
Remove the Python dependency in the demo script, to decrease the dependency
surface of the demo script.
Now the Mender-Artifact and Mender versions are parsed from the
docker-compose.client.yml and other-components.yml files through a simple AWK
script instead.
([MEN-2817](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-2817))
