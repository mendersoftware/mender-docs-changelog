### Changelogs

#### mender-connect (2.2.0)

New changes in mender-connect since 2.1.1:

##### Bug Fixes

* In Mender client v4.0, the `mender` binary has been split
  into `mender-update` and `mender-auth`. Modify `mender-connect` to call
  the right binary to trigger `check-update` and `send-inventory`
  ([MEN-6827](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6827))
* `mender-connect` systemd service can use either the old
  `mender-client` service or the new `mender-authd` service, which is the
  name of the authentication daemon of new Mender client. They are both
  kept as `Wants` and not `Require` so that `mender-connect` can run with
  either.
  ([MEN-6858](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6858))

##### Features

* build and test using the latest version of golang (1.21 today)
  ([QA-614](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/QA-614))


## mender-connect 2.1.2

_Released 06.12.2024_

### Changelogs

#### mender-connect (2.1.2)

New changes in mender-connect since 2.1.1:

##### Bug Fixes

* In Mender client v4.0, the `mender` binary has been split
  into `mender-update` and `mender-auth`. Modify `mender-connect` to call
  the right binary to trigger `check-update` and `send-inventory`
  ([MEN-6827](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6827))

  kept as `Wants` and not `Require` so that `mender-connect` can run with
  either.
  ([MEN-6858](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-6858))
* Stop shell after the ping/pong health check fails, so that
  the `mender-connect` can recover after disruption of connectivity.
  For already released versions of `mender-connect` the workaround is to
  force the stop of shells for expired sessions adding to the
  configuration options the fields:
  ```
    "Sessions": {
      "StopExpired": true,
      "ExpireAfterIdle": 600
    }
  ```
  Setting a limit for expiration high enough (10 minutes, above) so that it
  doesn't interfere with regular operations.

### Changelogs

#### mender-connect (2.0.0)

New changes in mender-connect since 1.2.0:

* Deprecate configuration fields `ServerURL` , `Servers`,
  `ServerCertificate`, `ClientProtocol`, `HTTPSClient` and `SkipVerify`.
  The server configuration is obtained via D-Bus API, for which from
  Mender 3.2 onwards is a local proxy which uses `mender.conf` client
  settings to securely authenticate with the backend server, making the
  client settings in `mender-connect.conf` redundant.
  ([MEN-5203](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-5203))
* Several robustness fixes around re-connection

  * Trigger re-connection when either token or server URL obtained from
    D-Bus signal has changed. Previously, it was enough with having a
    token with "some length" for the code to believe the device was
    authenticated and not trigger a re-connect.
  * Abort connecting after 10 retries. Previously it would reconnect
    forever with the same server URL, which will result in a deadlock if
    the url (or the token) changed while re-connecting.
